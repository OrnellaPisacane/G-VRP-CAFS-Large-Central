In addition, we also report information regarding the vehicle fuel tank capacity, the fuel consumption rate, the tour length, the average velocity, the size of the fleet. Finally, we add information on the seed used for the generator, the time spent for the starting refuel at depot (if any), the refueling time at stations and the service time at customers.
